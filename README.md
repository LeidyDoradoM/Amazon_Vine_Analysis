# Amazon Vine Analysis

This week module is all about Big data and the use of **Amazon Web Services (aws)** for cloud services as online storage and managing online databases. In specific, we will analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

## The Vine Program:

We will analyze the Toys customer reviews dataset from the [Amazon Review datasets](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt).  , and from there we will create an **AWS RDS database** with 4 tables in *pgAdmin*.

, and extract the dataset into a DataFrame. You'll transform the DataFrame into four separate DataFrames that match the table schema in pgAdmin. Then, you'll upload the transformed data into the appropriate tables and run queries in pgAdmin to confirm that the data has been uploaded.
